# Stately

State based routing aid for ui-router, the <i>de facto</i> routing solution for AngularJS. Stately aims to make debugging anything to do with routes as easy as possibly in any way that the user sees fit.

Stately is currently a work in progress and will not be considered any sort of working material until we come out with v0.1.0, until then, everything here is testing to get that dream.
